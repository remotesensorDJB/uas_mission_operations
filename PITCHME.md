@title[the big picture]
#### The Big Picture!
What is our objective?...  
  
@css[fragment](Capture **high quality imagery**) @css[fragment](of our **study area**,) @css[fragment](to suit the intended **application**,) @css[fragment](in a **safe, efficient, and professional** manner.)  
  
@css[fragment](All decisions related to field operations should emanate from this simple objective!)

@title[Study Area Reconnaissance]
#### Study Area Reconnaissance
##### Know B4 U Go! 
Our first task is to become familiar with the study area and its vicinity...  

  @css[fragment](general reconnaisance can be guided by a few questions.)

@title[Study Area Reconnaissance]
#### Study Area Reconnaissance   
@ul[squares]
- Where is the site? @css[fragment](**lat/long/elev/area of interest?**)
- How will we access it? @css[fragment](**driving/walking/need permissions?**)
- What is the terrain? @css[fragment](**steep slopes/tall trees/obstructions?**)
- Airspace considerations? @css[fragment](**require ATC permission/nearby facilities?**)
- What type of data to collect? @css[fragment](**aerial photos/3D Models/IR imagery?**)

#### Study Area Reconnaissance
Our main tools will be exisitng maps and imagery of the area.  
  
- [Google Maps/Streetview](https://maps.google.com)
- [Google Earth](https://earth.google.com)
- [Skyvector](https://www.skyvector.com)
- [Know B4 U Fly](http://knowbeforeyoufly.org/air-space-map/)
- [USGS Topo Maps](https://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=99cd5fbd98934028802b4f797c4b1732)

@title[Mission Plan Design]
#### Misson Plan Design
The *image acquisiton plan* that we design to capture imagery, will vary based on several factors...  
  
@ul[squares]
- Drone and camera type
- Image product priorities (2D Maps vs 3D Maps/Point Clouds, Area vs Structure)
- Area to be flown (shape and size)
- Terrain considerations
---
#### Misson Plan Design
##### Drone and Camera Type
The type of drone and sensor used will define the resolution (GSD) of resultant imagery. The sensor's field of view, lens focal length, and sensor resolution all contribute to the calculated GSD  at a given altitude.
